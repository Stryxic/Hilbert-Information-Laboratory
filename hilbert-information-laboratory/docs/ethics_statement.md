# Ethical Data Collection Statement

All data were collected from publicly accessible web domains between 2023–2025 using
the Hilbert Information Laboratory's ethical webscraper. Each crawl respected
robots.txt directives, implemented rate limiting (1–4 s), and stored metadata on
source, date, and status. No personal or private information was gathered.

All text was normalised to plain text and stripped of advertisements, cookies, or UI elements.
Each collected file includes source URLs, timestamps, and compliance metadata for reproducibility.

The corpus is released under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
